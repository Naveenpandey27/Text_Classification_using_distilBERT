# Text_Classification_using_distilBERT
This project showcases text classification using the ktrain library. It trains a machine learning model based on the 'distilbert-base-uncased' transformer and applies it to classify new text data into predefined categories. The project uses the 'fetch_20newsgroups' dataset from scikit-learn, which contains news articles from various domains.
